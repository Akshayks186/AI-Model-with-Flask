# AI-Model-with-Flask
Flask-Based Handwritten Digit Recognition API Overview This Flask application serves as an API for predicting handwritten digits using a pre-trained deep learning model. The app accepts an image (in base64 format), processes it, and returns the predicted digit. It also provides a simple frontend (index.html) for users to interact with the model.
